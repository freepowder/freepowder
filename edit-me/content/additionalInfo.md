I love outdoors, snowboarding in winter, skateboarding and cycling when the weather is good any time of the year. If the weather is not so good I usually enjoy building Lego.
I love cycle in London and I miss it so much since I moved out to live in Essex.
I like to play with technology and learn new things every day, addicted to tech twitter to keep up to date, and going to conferences and meetups is one of my favourite things to do. In 2023 I volunteer for React advanced London.
